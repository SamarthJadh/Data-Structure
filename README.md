## **Contents**
Below is a brief description of each file and its purpose:
1. **TBT.cpp**  
   Implementation of a Threaded Binary Tree (TBT), an extension of a binary tree with pointers for efficient in-order traversal without recursion.

2. **bst.cpp**  
   Implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST), which provides basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

3. **hash.cpp**  
   Demonstrates hashing techniques for implementing a hash table, including collision handling.

4. **inorder.cpp**  
   Implements in-order traversal of a binary tree. This file focuses on recursive and iterative approaches to traversal.

5. **spantree.cpp**  
   Implementation of algorithms for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph, such as Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm.

6. **stack.CPP**  
   Implementation of a stack data structure. Includes operations like push, pop, and display, demonstrating a Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure.

7.  **parking-mangement-system**  
   A project that simulates a parking management system. Includes functionality for vehicle entry, exit, and fee calculation. It demonstrates practical application of data structures and algorithms in a real-world scenario.
